# NetworkSecurity
This repository contains the lab report my teammate and I taught in the Network Security lab during my masters program. Some of the labs done by other students include:<br/>
* ARP Poisioning, 
* Honeypot setup
* Simple MitM attack,
* Vulnerability Assessment with OpenVas
* Intrusion detection and Firewalls <br/>
Constantly updating this repo with each labs remake for better knowledge retention.
