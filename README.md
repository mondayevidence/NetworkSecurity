# NetworkSecurity
This repository contains a recreation of some of the labs done in my Network Security course during my masters program. Some of the labs done include:<br/>
* Simple exploitation and pivoting with Metasploit,
* ARP Poisioning, 
* Honeypot setup
* Simple MitM attack,
* Vulnerability Assessment with OpenVas
* Intrusion detection and Firewalls <br/>
Constantly updating this repo with each labs remake for better knowledge retention.
